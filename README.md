# Group-16-TeamProject

We created the brand Techtopia to try and stand out from the competition and also appeal to our target audience which is technology enthusiasts by going with a futuristic look to our website and only selling the highest quality equipment.We specializes in the sale of technological equipment which focuses in the sale of keyboards, computer mice, microphones, monitors and cameras. Weâ€™ve achieved this with the use of our combined coding for the website where users can shop and purchase products and HTML, java, css, spring boot and thymeleaf for the admin page where selected admin users can access it to check stock levels.
