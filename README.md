# Group-16-TeamProject

TechTopia is a e-commerce site that sells technology from computers, phones and accessories. It is created during CS2TP term 2 module by group number 16

This only runs locally and on loalhost:8000 when the PHP servers are running locally. On this version the add and update product feature dosent work because since then i've implemented more sort options but sadly this clashed with the existing code for that but it was working in older verisions found on GitHub and also the one we used for the demo.
